# Spotify_DJ
A proposal for the use of reinforcement learning to create an AI-based DJ for Spotify
## Summary
Spotify DJ is a past project I worked on to test the efficacy of using reinforcement learning to create an AI-based DJ for Spotify. More specifically, this project tests whether using a multi-armed bandit can indeed make well informed song selections taking user feedback to create a user's preference profile in order to adjust its song selection trajectory.
